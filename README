README file for afterburner.py code:
This file contains instructions on how to run the afterburner code, 
as well as descriptions of the outputs of the code.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 0) Set up correct python packages

I modified the sklearn python package to be able to do Gaussian 
Mixture Modeling with weighted data points. To have python use the 
modified version, source the gmmsetups.sh file in this directory.

Step 1) Provide input files

The code takes three input files, and it is currently set up to look 
in one directory for all three files. Specify this directory by editing 
Line 19: indir='/input_directory/'

The first file is the cluster catalog. Specify this file by editing 
Line 20: clusterfile=indir+'cluster_file.fits'
This should be a FITS file, and must at least contain the RA, DEC,
and redshift of the cluster centers, and an ID number for each cluster. 

The second file is the galaxy catalog. Specify this file by editing
Line 21: galfile=indir+'galaxy_file.fits'
This should be a FITS file, and should contain galaxy ID numbers, RA, DEC, 
photometric redshift, redshift uncertainty, absolute magnitude, 
observed magnitudes in g,r,i,z bands, and rest frame g-r colors.

The third file is the observed color prediction file. Specify this file
by editing Line 22: colorfile=indir+'color_file.txt'
This should be a text file, and should contain redshift, g-r, r-i, i-z 
colors, in this order. 


Step 2) Specify output files

This code produces two output files. It will save both output files in 
the same directory. Specify this directory by editing
Line 24: outdir='/output_directory/'

The first output is the cluster file. Specify this file by editing
Line 25: cluster_outifle=outdir+'cluster.fit'

The second output is the members file. Specify this file by editing 
Line 26: member_outfile=outdir+'member.fit'


Step 3) Specify initial column names from input files

The input columns needed to make the appropriate cuts are specified in
Lines 40-54. Lines can be added or removed as needed for different cuts.

Step 4) Specify appropriate cuts

Cluster catalog cuts:

zmin, zmax (Lines 57 and 58) are minimum and maximum redshifts 
(typically zmin=0.1,zmax=1.0)

ra1 is the minimum RA value, ra2 is max. RA value. These can be edited as 
desired on Lines 60 and 61.
dec1 is minimum RA value, dec2 is max. RA value. These can be edited as 
desired on Lines 62 and 63.

A cut in ngals can also be used for the cluster catalog. 

The clustercut is defined in the w=np.where() statement on line 65, 
implemented on the following line.

Galaxy catalog cuts: 

zmin,zmax,ra1,ra2,dec1,dec2 same as cluster cuts. 
Note the different lines on which these are specified:
zmin/zmax on lines 68/69
ra1/ra2 on lines 71/72
dec1/des2 on lines 73/74
It is a good idea to make area/redshift range used for the galaxy file
slightly larger than what is used for the clusters (typically +1 degree
on each side in RA/DEC, +/- 0.05 to 0.1 in redshift). This prevents problems 
arising due to edge effects. 

A 'crazy color' cut is used for the galaxy catalog. This prevents 
galaxies with poorly measured colors from causing misfitting 
in the Gaussian Mixture Model step of the code. This color cut is 
typically made at -1 < color < 4. This cut can be changed by editing
Lines 77-78: crazy1=-1 	     crazy2=4

A cut on absolute magnitude brighter than -19 is included to ensure the 
parameters used in the HOD model are appropriate. Changing this would 
require recalibration of the HOD parameters

A cut on modest_class==1 is used to ensure only galaxies are included in the 
analysis. This cut applies to DES data but may be different for other 
data sets. 

Cuts on mult_niter_model>0 and flags_gold==0 are used for DES data to select 
only well measured galaxies. These cuts may differ for other data sets. 

The galaxy cuts are specified in the w=np.where() statement on line 83,
implemented on the following line


Step 5) Specify final column names from input files after cuts

All data columns needed to run the code are specified in Lines 93-114.
For each new data file, edit the column names appropriately. 

Lines 96-98 specify columns which may not be present in all catalogs.
They are NGALS, lambda_r (an estimate of the cluster radius), and 
maskfrac (a measure of what percentage of the cluster is masked). 
These three lines can be commented out without needing to make any 
changes to the code.
