2009-10-11 Martin
	=== Version 1.0 released ===
	
2010-01-20 Martin
	* tree code: Added correlation type 'wn', correlated weight of catalogue 1 with position of catalogue 2.
		E.g., use background magnitude as weight, and 2=foreground catalogue, and you measure	
		weak-lensing magnification.
	
2010-01-20 Martin
	* tree code: Bootstrap array from uint to double, to accomodate
	weights for type 'wn'
	
2010-01-21 Martin
	* woftheta_xcorr.pl: 'coord' key: Instead of 'radec', has now to be 'radec_rad' or 'radec_deg'.
		to specify the input coordinates (rad or deg).
	
2010-02-21 Martin
	* venice: time_dependent initialisation with call to 'times'
		works, no need for GSL_RNG_SEED anymore (which didn't work)

2010-03-01 Martin
	* tree code: Shear-shear correlation: Correction of Poisson error
	    implemented for OATH>0. D has to be downscaled by
	    (Nnode[b]/Npair[b]) for each bin b. A new column sqrt(Dcor) is
	    printed in file 'xi'.

2010-05-10 Martin
	* tree code: Added reference-frame-dependent quantities <gi gj>,
	i,j={1,2}

2010-05-20 Martin
	* tree code: Added config entry 'SCOORD_INPUT [string]' to specify
	input catalogue. Possible are 'arcsec', 'arcmin', 'deg',
	'rad'. Internally, all length quantities are now in [rad].

2010-06-11 Martin, Christopher
	* tree code: Added config entry 'SCOORD_OUTPUT [string] to specify
	  output coordinat unites. Tested with nn, gn, gg.

2010-06-11 Martin
	* cat2gal.pl, center_gal.pl: Cleaned up, fixed 'tan' (gnomonic) projection.
	* woftheta_xcorr.pl: Cleaned up.

2010-06-11 Martin
	* athena: Added command line options for output file names.
	=== Version 1.1 released ===
	
	2010-06-21	Martin
	*2pcf.c: Fixed bug: For ncat=1, first catalogue data is no longer copied to
 	               second cat, instead the catalogue adress is
		       assigned. This is necessary since only the first cat data is
	               swapped during partition to build first (and only)
	               tree. Surprisingly, this bug had no effect for
	               shear-shear and pos-pos, only magnification.

2010-07-25 Martin
	* athena: - Added -q, --quiet option
	                 - Reduced ridiculous precision of progress
	                 indicator

2010-07-28 Martin
	* athena: Added -t, --twins_merge option: Twin galaxies are merged into
   	                 one node
	* woftheta_xcorr.pl:
			- Added -p NPROC option, parallel running of
	                 'athena'
			- In case of projection, use 'tan' instead of
	                 'skynew'
	* woftheta_xcorr.pl, cat2gal.pl:
			- Added -q option, quiet(er) mode
	* woftheta_xcorr.pl, config_woftheta: Removed 'remove_multiple'
	                 key, using 'athena -t' to merge twin galaies.

2010-07-29 Martin
	=== Version 1.2 released ===

	* athena: Dealt with/supressed some icc compiler warnings.
	* athena: ECOSSTAT/tool files up to date

2010-08-26 Martin

		    merging)

2010-09-27 Martin
