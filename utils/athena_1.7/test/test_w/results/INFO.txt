The files 'w_theta_i_j_[LS|Ham].dat' are the results of running 'woftheta_xcorr.pl'
in the directory 'test_w'. The correct usage of the code should reproduce these
results within the error bars. Note that both the resampled and the Poisson errors
change from run to run since they depend on the realisation of the random catalogue.
